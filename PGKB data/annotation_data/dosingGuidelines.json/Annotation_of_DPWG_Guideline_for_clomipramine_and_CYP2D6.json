    "summary" : "Currently, there are very few guidelines linking the results of pharmacogenetic tests to specific therapeutic recommendations. Therefore, the Royal Dutch Association for the Advancement of Pharmacy established the Pharmacogenetics Working Group with the objective of developing pharmacogenetics-based therapeutic (dose) recommendations. After systematic review of the literature, recommendations were developed for 53 drugs associated with genes coding for CYP2D6, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, thiopurine-S-methyltransferase (TPMT), dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (DPD), vitamin K epoxide reductase (VKORC1), uridine diphosphate glucuronosyltransferase 1A1 (UGT1A1), HLA-B44, HLA-B*5701, CYP3A5, and factor V Leiden (FVL).",

Antidepressants that are not metabolised by CYP2C19 - or to a lesser extent - include, for example, fluoxetine, fluvoxamine and paroxetine. If it is not possible to avoid clomipramine: monitor the effect and side effects or the plasma concentrations of clomipramine and desmethylclomipramine. For obsessive compulsive disorder, the therapeutic plasma concentration of clomipramine is greater than 200 ng/mL in combination with a plasma concentration of desmethylclomipramine that is as low as possible. For anxiety disorders, the therapeutic plasma concentration of clomipramine is approximately 100 ng/mL in combination with a plasma concentration of desmethylclomipramine lower than 200 ng/mL. A sum of the plasma concentrations of clomipramine and desmethylclomipramine exceeding 600 ng/mL is considered toxic.

It is not known whether it is possible to reduce the dose to such an extent that the side effects disappear while the effectiveness is retained.
