    "summary" : "Currently, there are very few guidelines linking the results of pharmacogenetic tests to specific therapeutic recommendations. Therefore, the Royal Dutch Association for the Advancement of Pharmacy established the Pharmacogenetics Working Group with the objective of developing pharmacogenetics-based therapeutic (dose) recommendations. After systematic review of the literature, recommendations were developed for 53 drugs associated with genes coding for CYP2D6, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, thiopurine-S-methyltransferase (TPMT), dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (DPD), vitamin K epoxide reductase (VKORC1), uridine diphosphate glucuronosyltransferase 1A1 (UGT1A1), HLA-B44, HLA-B*5701, CYP3A5, and factor V Leiden (FVL).",

If an alternative is not possible: start with a very low dose and adjust the initial dose based on toxicity and efficacy. A substantiated recommendation for dose reduction cannot be made based on the literature. The recommendation for fluorouracil and capecitabine is to determine the residual DPD activity in mononuclear cells from peripheral blood and to adjust the initial dose accordingly. A patient with 0.5% of the normal DPD activity tolerated 0.8% of the standard capecitabine dose (150 mg every 5 days). A patient with undetectable DPD activity tolerated 0.43% of the standard capecitabine dose (150 mg every 5 days with every third dose skipped). The average Caucasian DPD activity is 9.9 nmol/hour per mg protein.<br/><em>NOTE: If a patient has two different gene variations that lead to a non-functional DPD enzyme (e.g. *2A and *13), this recommendation only applies if the variations are on a different allele.
