    "summary" : "Currently, there are very few guidelines linking the results of pharmacogenetic tests to specific therapeutic recommendations. Therefore, the Royal Dutch Association for the Advancement of Pharmacy established the Pharmacogenetics Working Group with the objective of developing pharmacogenetics-based therapeutic (dose) recommendations. After systematic review of the literature, recommendations were developed for 53 drugs associated with genes coding for CYP2D6, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, thiopurine-S-methyltransferase (TPMT), dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (DPD), vitamin K epoxide reductase (VKORC1), uridine diphosphate glucuronosyltransferase 1A1 (UGT1A1), HLA-B44, HLA-B*5701, CYP3A5, and factor V Leiden (FVL).",

Genetic variation results in an increased conversion of tacrolimus to inactive metabolites and as a result a higher dose is required. Adjustment of the initial dose results in an increased chance of reaching a tacrolimus concentration within the target range before the start of therapeutic drug monitoring on day three. However, there is no direct evidence that this results in improved clinical results.</p>\n<p><em>Wording in table taken from the <a rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://www.knmp.nl/downloads/pharmacogenetic-recommendations-november-2018.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Dutch guidelines</a>.</em></p>\n<table class=\"table\">\n<thead>\n<tr><th>Allele/Genotype/Phenotype</th><th>Drug</th><th>Recommendation Indications OTHER than liver transplantation</th><th>Recommendation LIVER transplantation</th></tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr><td>CYP3A5 heterozygote expressor</td><td>tacrolimus</td><td>Start with 1.75 times of the standard initial dose that would yield the desired result in non-expressors.
